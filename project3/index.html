          In 202X, the global technology and communication corporation OmniSyt has taken over the entire world.
          using their control over all information, they have engaged in information warfare and has taken over
          every government in the world. Using this power, OmniSyt is slowly taking away
          the freedom of all Internet users and charging impossible prices for all to use phones, Internet and more.
          all hacktivism groups have failed to defeat them, except one. The duo known as Nuts and Bolt have infiltrated
          their system and is attempting to disable their main servers, however, the server has sent two powerful programs
          to stop them.
