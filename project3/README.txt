The Last Hacktivists
This is a turn based role-playing game with top-down shooter elements. The player controls
two characters and must defeat two other characters. The player chooses how to act with
their characters before fighting, choose which character will be on the battlefield, then
go to battle, where the chosen character must avoid enemy bullets and shoot them back.
The game revolves around these two game segments: the choosing action and the battle.
The game ends when both player characters are defeated or when both enemy characters are
defeated.

The story is that in the near future, a technology company called OmniSyt
has taken control of the world through controlling information.
The world is filled with their surveillance tools and
the Internet is controlled by them as well. The player controls two hackers infiltrating
the company's base to destroy their servers and free the world from their clutches and must
defeat the AI security agents patrolling the servers.
I have chosen this story to fit with the theme of the future and the risk of global
monopoly by large tech companies is a real possibility given the situation that currently
exists.

The color scheme of bright green over black for the text is to evoke the aesthetics of old computer screens, the
text uses a very mechanical font to further this look. The in-game graphics uses pixel art which I have some
experience with when making other games in the past.

The game's feedback loops are something I came up with previously for a game I would like to make
and through this project, I want to test out if this combination of game ideas can work or not.
My main inspirations include an indie game called Flamebreak, the indie hits Undertale and Deltarune,
the MOBA League of Legends, the top-down Zelda games, turn-based RPGs in general, etc.

Originally, I wanted there to be chats with the in-game characters through jQuery UI's dialog boxes
but it was unwieldy and blocked the screen, so I just had the instruction text appear on top of the game
screen instead. There was going to be a way to restart the game, but there were problems and it was not a
necessary part of the game so it was removed. The Logic Bomb ability was to explode rather than deal damage directly
but there was no more time to add an explosion effect. I had many challenges while making this game, such as making the
angling red triangle of the player's cursor direction and making the enemies shoot, but both Pippin and Sam have been
great helps.

In the future, I would like to add more characters and also music for both the planning and fighting states, as well as
a more adaptive and intelligent movement pattern for enemies.
