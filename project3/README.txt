The Last Hacktivists
This is a turn based role-playing game with top-down shooter elements. The player controls
two characters and must defeat two other characters. The player chooses how to act with
their characters before fighting, choose which character will be on the battlefield, then
go to battle, where the chosen character must avoid enemy bullets and shoot them back.
The game revolves around these two game segments: the choosing action and the battle.
The game ends when both player characters are defeated or when both enemy characters are
defeated.

The story is that in the near future, a technology company called OmniSyt (as in omni and
sight, all seeing) has taken control of the world through manipulation information available
to people as well as through collecting their data to sell to the powerful and to commit
extorsion to prevent competition. The world is filled with their surveillance tools and
the Internet is controlled by them as well. The player controls two hackers infiltrating
the company's base to destroy their servers and free the world from their clutches and must
defeat the AI security agents patrolling the servers.

The game's feedback loops are something I came up with previously for a game I would like to make
and through this project, I want to test out if this combination of game ideas can work or not.
