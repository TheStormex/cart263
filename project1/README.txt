This interactive project is a clicker game on a webpage. The user / player's goal is to buy happiness by clicking on the 
'Buy!' button. To achieve this task, the player must accumulate wealth through clicking on jobs that appear temporarily
to get a set amount of cash per click. There are problems in life and living expenses that come up and drain one's money 
away which will appear on the bottom and take away the player's wealth every half second. The player must click on them enough times to
make them go away. Doing so they are spending time not on accumulating money so the problems are an obstacle that hinders
the player's progress. To emulate the story of Sisyphus

-if have enough, either the big problem come up or the price changes to be higher (50% chance of either happening)
-get money from clicking on job stuff
-lose money from problems that pop up every tick, must click them to remove them
-saving up for Happiness (money can't buy happiness)
-more problems come up the closer the money gets to the cost to buy happiness
-if have enough, a problem called (money can't buy happiness) comes up and takes away 25% instantly.
