    <p> Got banned <span class="redacted"> from my favorite movie theater </span> for askinf if the qt3.14
       <span class="redacted"> concessions girl </span> could serve me soda with some <span class="redacted"> of her pee </span> in it.</p>
    <p> Why would I get banned for this? It's not like I was asking her hand
       in marriage or something. If she doesn't want <span class="redacted"> to piss in my cup </span> then she
      could've said no and that would be it. </p>
    <p> I hate it when hoes make it out like I was trying to <span class="redacted"> rape her or something.
      It's your piss, </span> it's useless to you, you'd rather flush it down the toilet
      than giving it to a fellow human being? </p>
    <p> It's ok if you think it's gross, you don't have to do it if you don't want.
       But to ban people just for requesting........ imagine it was <span class="redacted"> "tears" instead
      of "piss". </span> Or nail clippings. Would they still ban me? </p>
