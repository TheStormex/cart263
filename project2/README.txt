'Child-Friendly Videos Simulator 2020'
by Che Tan

  This interactive webpage is a simulation of the experience of a young child
exploring the child-friendly videos curated towards them on YouTube. The user
is given a choice between three videos they can click on to watch, or let the autoplay
feature to select the first option for them after five seconds. When the video name is clicked,
the user sees how the video has affected the child based on the image that has just appeared in
the background, which represents the child's mind. At first, the videos all have cheesy
innocuous titles that are appropriate, having a positive effect on the child's mind as
they teach about school, vegetables, friends and other subjects. After the first four
videos, there begins to be a chance that the video titles include bad words like gore,
war, blood and other edgy adult subjects mixed in with the rest of the inoffensive words.
If the user clicks on such a video, the background darkens, the title turns redder and the
background music slows down. If the user sees the bad words in the title and clicks
on a video without it, it has a positive effect and the imaginary child is not harmed.
However, with each set of videos, the chance of bad videos appearing increases,
making it eventually impossible to watch a video without harmful content and causing
disturbing imagery to be generated instead. Eventually, when all eight images are
bad images, the simulation ends and a message is shown to the user warning them of the
harm letting children watch seemingly harmless videos can cause since there is no
guarantee they are actually good.

  The Responsive Voice is used to simulate the inner voice of the child,
who is either happy or sad after watching a video. There are also sound effects
when a video is watched, either static akin to changing TV channels for good
videos or old Internet boot-up for bad videos because it sounds a bit scary.

  The webpage goes from child-friendly looking with the pink title, baby blue
background, innocent images and upbeat music to unnerving and scary in order
to simulate the child's feelings of betrayal and shock from being shown
such content to the user, so that they can have a better understanding of the
severity of the situation.

  All images are found on Google images with the setting of
allowing non commercial reuse. The sound effects are from
YouTube sound effect videos. The background music
was made by me for an animation class in Dawson College.
